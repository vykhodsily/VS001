## Descriptoin

With its debut release newly launched Vykhod Sily Recordings celebrates the 2 tracker EP from the tribal wizards dreadmaul & Bereneces who are responsible for the serious soundsystem damage worldwide over the recent years. The result of their collaborative work for VS Recordings is two dark cuts each of them are unique in its own right. Heading at the ghostly depths of halftempo drum-n-bass these two giving us the rising sense of dread with their murky swamped-out vibes. The monster tune “Aakhu” attacks with heavy subs and sharp percussion while contagious “Intercontinental” is killing us on quite meditative and delicate tip. Both tunes can be possibly defined as the modern acoustic rituals in the dead of night. Come join the tribe. 

The 2 tracker EP is available on our website (vykhodsily.net) for free, as well as on the selected streaming services (iTunes, Spotify etc.). Maximum respect to all the patrons at http://patreon.com/vykhodsily_podcast who made this possible by supporting us with pledges during the last 7 months. It's all happening now! You know the score!
